# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
Basketball.

What do you know about?
Math and Physics.

What decisions do you face?
Whether or not to believe the hype about a player or team.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation


2. Trend related to the news
Markelle Fultz has improved his jumpshot.

3. Who does that?

What skillsets add value to a franchise.

6. What's the most popular?

7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Humans tend to do a poor job of understanding statistics and interpret events in a sporting environment incorrectly.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
A recent look at how certain stats said a player considered to be at an elite level defensively was actually hurting his team's defense while he was on the court.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Likely not.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
I would more likely look at a different player from the offensive perspective.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Yes. Looking at someone who people assume is great offensively, but that further analysis may prove to be a hindrance.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
I've found a way of scraping NBA.com
